              <p class="italic">
                Gain access to your target's mind and unleash a burst of energy directly into their brain, causing anything from a
                nosebleed to a full aneurysm.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Default</span>. Mind Spike deals 1 damage directly to the Health of a
                target creature that the caster can see and which the caster is touching with at least one hand. Mind Spike can only damage a creature once per day, though other Effects can be renewed and re-applied without limit.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Spell Enhancements</span>. The intensity and range of Mind Spike can
                be upgraded, and enhancements can add additional effects. Each effect must be taken in order, but any number of different effects can be added. The only limit to the additions is resources and time, so in theory a Qoyaanic could max out every effect.
                
                Effects:
                <ul class="left-align">
                  <li><span class="bold italic">Stamina Damage</span>: Instead of targeting Health, you can choose to target Stamina</li>
                  <li><span class="bold italic">Apply Condition</span>: Force the target to succeed on a Saving Throw or suffer your choice of available Condition for 1 round</li>
                  <li><span class="bold italic">Know Location</span>: If you damage the target with Mind Spike, you can take a minute to concentrate and know its direction and distance in relation to you</li>
                  <li><span class="bold italic">Savagery</span>: Forego all other effects of the spell to damage a target for the second time in the same day</li>
                </ul>
