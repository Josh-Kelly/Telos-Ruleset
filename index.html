              <div>
                <p>
                  Each single source of physical damage must deal damage greater than the Armor Class or the damage is negated.
                  Armor Class does NOT reduce damage, ever, so if a source of damage exceeds the Armor Class, the full damage is
                  applied to the creature.
                </p>
                <p class="example-text">
                  EXAMPLE: As the goblin horde descends on the gnome PC, Lykaia in her werewolf form throws herself over the
                  gnome’s body and curls into a ball to protect her. The goblins hack at Lykaia’s hide, hitting automatically
                  because Lykaia is making no move to defend herself. However, Lykaia’s werewolf hide has an AC of 6. The goblins
                  deal 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, and 6 damage. Lykaia shrugs off the first six attacks, but the seventh bites deep enough
                  to harm her.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Each single source of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that is not negated by the target’s Armor Class
                  is reduced by the armor’s Damage Reduction. Leftover damage is subtracted from the target’s Stamina/Health. DR
                  is always equal to or lower than AC.
                </p>
                <p class="example-text">
                  EXAMPLE: Continuing from the example above, Lykaia’s werewolf hide has a DR of 4, so even though the goblin
                  managed to break through her AC and hurt her, the 6 damage is reduced by 4 to 2. Her Stamina (if she has any
                  left) is reduced by 2, and any leftover damage reduces her Health.

            The Network is the party’s home base, haven, and fallback point. It is probably where many character loved ones live,
            as well as NPCs beloved by the players. It is both a responsibility and a powerful and necessary tool for forging real
            change in a world on the brink, in which solutions cannot be found in the simple killing of a certain monster or
            recovery of a certain artifact.
          </div>

          <div>
            The PCs spearhead real change, but the Network extends their reach and sustains and expands the results of their
            efforts.
          </div>

          <div>
            A Network can take the form of a permanent caravan, thieves’ guild, small town, or other similar grouping. It needs
            people and it needs Ground that is its own.

              <div>
                Each Downtime period, the Network can be directed to focus on a specific task – Build, Forage, Defend, etc. To
                determine its level of success, the Networker rolls a d20, adds and subtracts bonuses and penalties, and compares
                it to a DC. A success might produce Supply, mitigate a Crisis, or provide some other bonus.
              </div>
              <div>
                By default, the Network only gets one Network roll per Downtime, but the number of rolls can be increased by
                creating Network Branches, each of which gets its own roll.

                  “Discretion,” “Veil,” or “Rumor.” In a campaign centered around a warcamp, the Boon could be “Might” or “Chain

                  Crises represent major and ongoing problems that face the Network – an out-of-the-ordinary drain on the

                  A Network is not always facing a Crisis, but there is also no limit to the number of Crises a Network can be
                  facing at once. It can come down to a real choice – dissolve the Network so its people survive, or try to
                  withstand what is coming at the likely cost of many of its people.

                  Unresolved Crises deal periodic damage to the Network. The period is rarely daily, and is most often weekly or

                  Supply is an abstraction of the food, clothing, equipment, and general surplus produced by the Network for its
                  use. Supply refers specifically to the surplus produced by the Population and is separate from day-to-day use
                  and consumption.

                <div>
                  <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Supply and Crises</span>. When the Network suffers from a Crisis,
                  the Crisis deals damage to the Supply each week or month that the Crisis is not resolved. The damage usually
                  ranges from 1d6 – 4d6 per Crisis. If the Network has zero Supply and takes damage, or if there is leftover
                  damage from the Crisis that reduced Supply to zero, the damage is dealt directly to the Population.

                  Special supplies can be traded for great wealth, or used internally to improve the Network itself in

Qoyaanics are an equipment-heavy class which require a great deal of time, attention to detail, and equipment-management to play effectively. If you enjoy carefully tracking resources, planning optimal equiment, and playing a class with cataclysmic potential but a very slow character progression, this class is for you. If you want quick and dirty magic of greater variety but less potency, try a sorcerer.

                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Qoyaanic Scrollcrafters</span>. Qoyaanics study the mathematic and alchemical relationships of earth, air, fire, water, heat, cold, lightning, force, and other elements. The Qoyaanic manipulates these forces and elements to ward and protect, shatter and destroy, predict, and See.

                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Casting Spells</span>. A Qoyaanic can technically cast a spell using only her intellect. Doing so is dangerous for the Qoyaanic and everyone around her, and failure threatens at least reality in the local area, so Qoyaanics cast spells using exclusively Scrolls and magically-imbued equipment.

              <div>
                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Scrolls</span>. Scrolls are specially-prepared paper magically imbued to receive the imprint of a Qoyaanic's will, enforced with special ink the Qoyaanic uses to inscribe a particular effect. To cause the effect, the Qoyaanic need only concentrate and recite the Scroll.

                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Dangerous and Limited</span>. Scrolls are dangerous, expensive, and time-consuming to make, and can only be carried in small numbers lest they interact negatively with each other - they have been known to detonate or mix formulae with other Scrolls, causing unexpected and devastating effects. A Qoyaanic must continually concentrate some portion of willpower to keep her carried Scrolls in line.

              <div>
                <span class="bold italic light-orange-text">Specialized Equipment</span>. Every order of Qoyaanics has devised specialized equipment in the form of staves, wands, crowns, bracelets, and other objects which can be inscribed with Qoyaanic runes. These items are not in themselves magical, but serve as foci for the Qoyaanic's casting. In the case of a failed Scrollcasting roll, the focus can be destroyed in order to absorb the damage that would otherwise have occurred.

                When you attempt to cast a spell, with or without a Scroll, and you have a hand free, you can make use of inscribed equipment as a focus. When you fail a Scrollcasting roll, the piece of equipment associated with the spell is destroyed, negating a single, negative effect of the failed roll.
