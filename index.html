          <div class="side-by-side">

                <h4>Armor Class (AC)</h4>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Each single source of physical damage must deal damage greater than the Armor Class or the damage is negated.
                  Armor Class does NOT reduce damage, ever, so if a source of damage exceeds the Armor Class, the full damage is
                  applied to the creature.
                </p>
                <p class="example-text">
                  EXAMPLE: As the goblin horde descends on the gnome PC, Lykaia in her werewolf form throws herself over the
                  gnome’s body and curls into a ball to protect her. The goblins hack at Lykaia’s hide, hitting automatically
                  because Lykaia is making no move to defend herself. However, Lykaia’s werewolf hide has an AC of 6. The goblins
                  deal 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, and 6 damage. Lykaia shrugs off the first six attacks, but the seventh bites deep enough
                  to harm her.

                <h4>Damage Reduction (DR)</h4>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Each single source of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that is not negated by the target’s Armor Class
                  is reduced by the armor’s Damage Reduction. Leftover damage is subtracted from the target’s Stamina/Health. DR
                  is always equal to or lower than AC.
                </p>
                <p class="example-text">
                  EXAMPLE: Continuing from the example above, Lykaia’s werewolf hide has a DR of 4, so even though the goblin
                  managed to break through her AC and hurt her, the 6 damage is reduced by 4 to 2. Her Stamina (if she has any
                  left) is reduced by 2, and any leftover damage reduces her Health.

            The Network is the party’s home base, haven, and fallback point. It is probably where many character loved ones live,
            as well as NPCs beloved by the players. It is both a responsibility and a powerful and necessary tool for forging real
            change in a world on the brink, in which solutions cannot be found in the simple killing of a certain monster or
            recovery of a certain artifact.
          </div>

          <div>
            The PCs spearhead real change, but the Network extends their reach and sustains and expands the results of their
            efforts.
          </div>

          <div>
            A Network can take the form of a permanent caravan, thieves’ guild, small town, or other similar grouping. It needs
            people and it needs Ground that is its own.
          </div>

          <div>
            <span class="bold">Network Rolls</span>. Each Downtime period, the Network can be directed to focus on a specific task
            – Build, Forage, Defend, etc. To determine its level of success, the Networker rolls a d20, adds and subtracts bonuses
            and penalties, and compares it to a DC. A success might produce Supply, mitigate a Crisis, or provide some other
            bonus.

                Each Downtime period, the Network can be directed to focus on a specific task – Build, Forage, Defend, etc. To
                determine its level of success, the Networker rolls a d20, adds and subtracts bonuses and penalties, and compares
                it to a DC. A success might produce Supply, mitigate a Crisis, or provide some other bonus.
