        <h2 class="bold">Networks</h2>

        <div>
          The Network is the party’s home base, haven, and fallback point. It is probably where many character loved ones live, as
          well as NPCs beloved by the players. It is both a responsibility and a powerful and necessary tool for forging real
          change in a world on the brink, in which solutions cannot be found in the simple killing of a certain monster or
          recovery of a certain artifact.
        </div>

        <div>
          The PCs spearhead real change, but the Network extends their reach and sustains and expands the results of their
          efforts.
        </div>

        <div>
          A Network can take the form of a permanent caravan, thieves’ guild, small town, or other similar grouping. It needs
          people and it needs Ground that is its own.
        </div>

        <div>
          <span class="bold">Network Rolls</span>. Each Downtime period, the Network can be directed to focus on a specific task –
          Build, Forage, Defend, etc. To determine its level of success, the Networker rolls a d20, adds and subtracts bonuses and
          penalties, and compares it to a DC. A success might produce Supply, mitigate a Crisis, or provide some other bonus.
        </div>

        <div>Network Aspects. The Network has four attributes: Boon, Bane, Population, and Supply.</div>
