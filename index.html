          <h4 id="armor-class-explanation">Armor Class</h4>
          <img src="armor-class.jpg" alt="Image: Armor Class Example" />
          <div class="side-by-side">
            <p>
              Each single source of physical damage must deal damage greater than the Armor Class or the damage is negated. Armor
              Class does NOT reduce damage, ever, so if a source of damage exceeds the Armor Class, the full damage is applied to
              the creature.
            </p>
            <p class="example-text">
              As the goblin horde descends on the gnome PC, Lykaia in her werewolf form throws herself over the gnome’s body and
              curls into a ball to protect her. The goblins hack at Lykaia’s hide, hitting automatically because Lykaia is making
              no move to defend herself. However, Lykaia’s werewolf hide has an AC of 6. The goblins deal 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, and 6
              damage. Lykaia shrugs off the first six attacks, but the seventh bites deep enough to harm her.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4 id="damage-reduction-explanation">Damage Reduction</h4>
          <img src="damage-reduction.jpg" alt="Image: Damage Reduction Example" />
          <div class="side-by-side">
            <p>
              Each single source of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that is not negated by the target’s Armor Class is
              reduced by the armor’s Damage Reduction. Leftover damage is subtracted from the target’s Stamina/Health. DR is
              always equal to or lower than AC.
            </p>
            <p class="example-text">
              Keeping with the example above, Lykaia’s werewolf hide has a DR of 4, so even though the goblin managed to break
              through her AC and hurt her, the 6 damage is reduced by 4 to 2. Her Stamina (if she has any left) is reduced by 2,
              and any leftover damage reduces her Health.

          <div>
            The Network is the party’s home base, haven, and fallback point. It is probably where many character loved ones live,
            as well as NPCs beloved by the players. It is both a responsibility and a powerful and necessary tool for forging real
            change in a world on the brink, in which solutions cannot be found in the simple killing of a certain monster or
            recovery of a certain artifact.
          </div>

          <div>
            The PCs spearhead real change, but the Network extends their reach and sustains and expands the results of their
            efforts.
          </div>

          <div>
            A Network can take the form of a permanent caravan, thieves’ guild, small town, or other similar grouping. It needs
            people and it needs Ground that is its own.
          </div>

          <div>
            <span class="bold">Network Rolls</span>. Each Downtime period, the Network can be directed to focus on a specific task
            – Build, Forage, Defend, etc. To determine its level of success, the Networker rolls a d20, adds and subtracts bonuses
            and penalties, and compares it to a DC. A success might produce Supply, mitigate a Crisis, or provide some other
            bonus.
